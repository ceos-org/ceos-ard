### What is CEOS Analysis Ready Data?

CEOS-ARD are products that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort. In general, these products would be resampled onto a common geometric grid (for a given product) and would provide baseline data for further interoperability both through time and with other datasets. 

CEOS-ARD products are intended to be flexible and accessible products suitable for a wide range of users for a wide variety of applications, including particularly time series analysis and multi-sensor application development. They are also intended to support rapid ingestion and exploitation via high-performance computing, cloud computing and other future data architectures. They may not be suitable for all purposes and are not intended as a ‘replacement’ for other types of satellite products.

### When can a product be called CEOS-ARD?

The CEOS-ARD branding is applied to a particular product once:

- that product has been assessed as meeting CEOS-ARD requirements by the agency responsible for production and distribution of the product, and
- that the assessment has been peer reviewed by the relevant CEOS team(s).

Agencies or other entities considering undertaking an assessment process should consult the CEOS-ARD [Governance Framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15grQ79D-Ge8PN1_4_XDmci5iezs8HAcOpLcM7d2wmAo/edit?usp=sharing).

A product can continue to use CEOS-ARD branding as long as its generation and distribution remain consistent with the peer-reviewed assessment.

### What is the difference between Threshold and Goal?

**Threshold (Minimum) Requirements** are the MINIMUM that is needed for the data to be analysis ready. This must be practical and accepted by the data producers.

**Goal (Desired) Requirements** (previously referred to as “Target”) are the ideal; where we would like to be. Some providers may already meet these.

Products that meet all threshold requirements should be immediately useful for scientific analysis or decision-making. 

Products that meet goal requirements will reduce the overall product uncertainties and enhance broad-scale applications. For example, the products may enhance interoperability or provide increased accuracy through additional corrections that are not reasonable at the *threshold* level. 

Goal requirements anticipate continuous improvement of methods and evolution of community expectations, which are both normal and inevitable in a developing field. Over time, *goal* specifications may (and subject to due process) become accepted as Threshold requirements.
