title: Spectral Bands
requirements:
  minimum:
    - description: >-
        The central wavelength and full width at half maximum for each spectral band for which data is included is identified in the metadata, expressed in SI units.
  desired:
    - description: >-
        As threshold, with instrument spectral response details (e.g., full spectral response function) also included or directly accessible using details in the metadata.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        Information on spectral bands should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
