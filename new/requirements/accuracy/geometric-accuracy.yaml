    - description: >-
        The metadata includes metrics describing the assessed geodetic accuracy of the data, expressed units of the coordinate system of the data. Accuracy is assessed by independent verification (as well as internal model-fit where applicable). Uncertainties are expressed quantitatively, for example, as root mean square error (RMSE) or Circular Error Probability (CEP90, CEP95), etc.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        Information on geometric accuracy of the data should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
