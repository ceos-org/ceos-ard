title: Geometric Correction
requirements:
  minimum:
    - description: >-
        Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved in relative geolocation, that is, the pixels from the same instrument and platform are consistently located, and are thus comparable, through time.
        Sub-pixel accuracy is taken to be less than or equal to 0.5-pixel radial root mean square error (rRMSE) or equivalent in Circular Error Probability (CEP) relative to a defined reference image.
        A consistent gridding/sampling frame is used, including common cell size, origin, and nominal sample point location within the cell (centre, ll, ur).
        Relevant metadata must be provided under 1.8 and 1.9.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        The threshold level will not necessarily enable interoperability between data from *different* sources as the geometric corrections for each of the sources may differ.
  desired:
    - description: >-
        Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved relative to an identified absolute independent terrestrial referencing system (such as a national map grid).
        A consistent gridding/sampling frame is necessary to meet this requirement.
        Relevant metadata must be provided under 1.8 and 1.9.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        This requirement is intended to enable interoperability between imagery from different platforms that meet this level of correction and with non-image spatial data such as GIS layers and terrain models.
