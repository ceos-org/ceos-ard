title: Algorithms
requirements:
  minimum:
    - description: >-
        All algorithms, and the sequence in which they were applied in the generation process, are identified in the metadata. For example, these may be available through Algorithm Theoretical Basis documents.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
  desired:
    - description: >-
        As threshold, but only algorithms that have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        It is possible that high-quality corrections are applied through non-disclosed processes. CARD4L does not per-se require full and open data and methods.
    - type: note
      description: >-
        Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
