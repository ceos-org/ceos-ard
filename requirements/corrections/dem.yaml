    - During ortho-rectification, the data provider shall use the same DEM that was used for the radiometric terrain flattening to ensure consistency of the data stack.
    - Provide reference to Digital Elevation Model used for geometric terrain correction.
    - Provide reference to Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) used for geometric correction.
