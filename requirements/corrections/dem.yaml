    - During ortho-rectification, the data provider shall use the same DEM that was used for the radiometric terrain flattening to ensure consistency of the data stack.
    - Provide reference to Digital Elevation Model used for geometric terrain correction.
    - Provide reference to Earth Gravitational Model (EGM) used for geometric correction.

    - A DEM with comparable or better resolution to the resolution of the output CEOS-ARD product shall be used if available.
      Else, the upsampled DEM is identified.
    - Resampling method used for preparation of the DEM.
    - Method used for resampling the EGM.
