    Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved in **relative** geolocation, that is, the pixels from the same instrument and platform are consistently located, and are thus comparable, through time.

    Sub-pixel accuracy is taken to be less than or equal to 0.5 pixel radial root mean square error (rRMSE) or equivalent in Circular Error Probability (CEP) relative to a defined reference image.

    A consistent gridding/sampling frame is necessary to meet this requirement.

    Relevant metadata must be provided under [@metadata/geometric-accuracy-st] and [@metadata/instrument-optical].
  notes:
    - |-
      The threshold level will not necessarily enable interoperability between data from **different** sources as the geometric corrections for each of the sources may differ. 
goal:
  # todo: The last two paragraphs are already a threshold req. -> remove below?
  description: |-
    Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved relative to an identified absolute independent terrestrial referencing system (such as a national map grid).

    A consistent gridding/sampling frame is necessary to meet this requirement.

    Relevant metadata must be provided under [@metadata/geometric-accuracy-st] and [@metadata/instrument-optical].
  notes:
    - |-
      This requirement is intended to enable interoperability between imagery from different platforms that meet this level of correction, and with non-image spatial data such as GIS layers and terrain models.
