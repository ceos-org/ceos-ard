title: Gridding Convention

  description: |-
    A consistent gridding/sampling frame is used. The origin is chosen to minimise any need for subsequent resampling between multiple products (be they from the same or different providers).
    This is typically accomplished via a “snap to grid” in relation to the most proximate grid tile in a global system.
  notes:
    - If a product hierarchy of resolutions exists (or is planned), the multiple resolutions should nest within each other (e.g., 12.5m, 25m, 50m, 100m, etc.), and not be disjoint.

    Provide DOI or URL to gridding convention used.

    When multiple providers share a common map projection, providers are encouraged to standardise the origins of their products among each other.

    In the case of UTM/UPS coordinates, the upper left corner coordinates should be set to an integer multiple of sample intervals from a 100 km by 100 km grid tile of the Military Grid Reference System's 100k coordinates (“snap to grid”).

    For products presented in geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), the origin should be set to an integer multiple of samples in relation to the closest integer degree.
