    Adjustments were made for terrain by modelling the local contributing scattering area using the preferred choice of a published peer-reviewed algorithm to produce radiometrically terrain corrected (RTC) $\gamma^0_T$ backscatter estimates.  

    Metadata references, e.g.

    - a citable peer-reviewed algorithm
    - technical documentation regarding the algorithm used to generate the backscatter estimates is expressed as URLs or DOIs 
    - the sources of auxiliary data used to make corrections

    Require resolution of DEM better than the output product resolution when applying terrain corrections. 
  notes:
    - Examples of technical documentation include an Algorithm, Theoretical Basis Document, product user guide, etc.
