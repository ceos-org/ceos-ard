  description: |-
    Values provided under [@corrections/geometric-accuracy-radar] are provided by the SAR mission Cal/Val team.

    CEOS-ARD processing steps could include method refining the geometric accuracy, such as cross-correlation of the SAR data in slant range with a SAR scene simulated from a DSM or DEM.

    Methodology used (name and reference), quality flag, geometric standard deviation values should be provided.
