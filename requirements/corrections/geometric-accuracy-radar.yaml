    Accurate geolocation is a prerequisite to radar processing to correct for terrain and to enable interoperability between radar sensors.

    The absolute geolocation error (ALE) for a sensor is typically assessed through analysis of Single Look Complex (SLC) imagery and measured along the slant range and azimuth directions (case A: SLC ALE).

    The end-to-end “ARD” ALE of the final product could be measured directly in the final image product in the chosen map projection, i.e., in the map coordinate directions: e.g., Northing and Easting (case B: ARD ALE).

    Providing accuracy estimates based on measurements following at least one scheme (A or B or both) meets the threshold requirement.
    
    Estimates of the ALE is provided as a bias and a standard deviation, with (Case A) SLC ALE expressed in slant range and azimuth, and (Case B) ARD ALE expressed in map projection dimensions.
  notes:
    - This assessment is often made through comparison of measured corner reflector positions with their projected location in the imagery. In some cases, other mission calibration/validation results may be used.
    - The ALE is not typically assessed for every processed image, but through an ALE assessment by the data processing team characterizing all or (usually a subset) of the generated products. 
goal:
  description: |-
    Output product sub-sample accuracy should be less than or equal to 0.1 (slant range) pixel radial root mean square error (rRMSE).
