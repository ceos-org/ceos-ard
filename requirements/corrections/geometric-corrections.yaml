    Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved in relative geolocation, that is, the pixels from the same instrument and platform are consistently located, and thus, comparable through time.

    Sub-pixel accuracy is taken to be less than or equal to 0.5-pixel radial root mean square error (rRMSE) or equivalent in Circular Error Probability (CEP) relative to a defined reference image.

    A consistent gridding/sampling frame is used, including common cell size, origin, and nominal sample point location within the cell (centre, ll, ur).

    Relevant metadata must be provided under item 1.8 and 1.9.
  notes:
    - The threshold level will not necessarily enable interoperability between data from *different* sources as the geometric corrections for each of the sources may differ.
goal:
  description: |-
    Sub-pixel accuracy is achieved relative to an identified absolute independent terrestrial referencing system (such as a national map grid). 

    A consistent gridding/sampling frame is necessary to meet this requirement.

    Relevant metadata must be provided under 1.8 and 1.9.
  notes:
    - This requirement is intended to enable interoperability between imagery from different platforms that meet this level of correction and with non-image spatial data such as GIS layers and terrain models.
