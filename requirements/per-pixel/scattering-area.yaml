    DEM-based scattering area image used for Gamma-Nought terrain normalisation is provided.
    This quantifies the local scattering area used to normalise for radiometric distortions induced by terrain to the measured $\beta^0$ backscatter.
    The terrain-flattened $\gamma^0_T$ is best understood as $\beta^0$ divided by the local scattering area.
