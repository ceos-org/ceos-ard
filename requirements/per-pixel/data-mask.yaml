    Mask image indicating:

    - Valid data
    - Invalid data
    - No data

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Sample Type (Mask)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
    - Bit Value Representation

    As threshold, including additional bit value representations, e.g.:

    - Layover (masked as invalid data in threshold)
    - Radar shadow (masked as invalid data in threshold)
    - Ocean water
    - Land (recommended for ORB)
    - RTC applied (e.g., for maritime scenes with land samples for which RTC has been applied)
    - DEM gap filling (i.e., interpolated DEM over gaps)
