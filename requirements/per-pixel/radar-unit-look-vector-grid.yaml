    3-D components radar unit look vector, specified at each pixel in an Earth-Centred Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinate system (also called Earth Centred Rotating – ECR) is provided.
    It consists of unit vectors from the antenna to the surface pixel (i.e., positive Z component).

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Sample Type (3D unit vector)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
