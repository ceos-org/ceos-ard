# Remove "Per-Pixel" from the title, it's inconsistent with other requirements.

threshold: null
goal:
  # todo: there's an ORB specific part, which could be removed as the requirment doesn't apply to ORB?!
  # todo: remove mention of CEOS-ARD and SAR to be reusable outside of CEOS
  description: |-
    Provide DEM or DSM as used during the geometric and radiometric processing of the SAR data, resampled to an exact geometric match in extent and resolution with the CEOS-ARD SAR image product.
    
    Can also be provided with ORB products containing land areas.
