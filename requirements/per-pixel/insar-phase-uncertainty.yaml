  description: |-
    Estimate of uncertainty in InSAR phase is provided, such as finite signal to noise ratio, quantization noise, or DEM error.
    Identification of which error sources are included will be provided as DOI/URL reference or brief description.
    It represents statistical variation from known noise sources only.

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Sample Type (Angle)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
