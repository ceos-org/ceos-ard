title: Acquisition ID Image

    **Required for multi-source product only.**

    Acquisition ID, or acquisition date, for each pixel is identified.

    In case of multi-temporal image stacks, use source acquisition ID (i.e., [@metadata/sequential-id]) to list contributing images.

    In case of date, data represent (integer or fractional) day offset to reference observation date (in UTC). Date used as reference (“Day 0”) is provided in the metadata.

    Pixels not representing a unique date (e.g., pixels averaged in image overlap zones) are flagged with a pre-set pixel value that is provided in the metadata.
    
    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Sample type (Day, Time, ID)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per sample
    - Byte Order

    In case of image composites, the sources for each pixel are uniquely identified.
