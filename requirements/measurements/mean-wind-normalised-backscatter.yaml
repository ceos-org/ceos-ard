    Mean wind-normalised (over ocean) backscatter coefficient is provided for each available polarization.
    It is calculated as the ratio between the backscatter intensity and a simulated backscatter intensity image generated using an ocean surface wind model such as, e.g., [@quilfen1998] or [@vachon2000] for VV and HH polarization respectively.
