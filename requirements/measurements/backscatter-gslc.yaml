  description: |-
    Radiometric and Phase Terrain-flattened Gamma-Nought backscatter coefficient ($\gamma^0_T$), in complex number format, is provided for each polarization (e.g., HH, HV, VV, VH).

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Measurement Type (Gamma-Nought)
    - Backscatter Expression Convention (linear amplitude, linear power\*)
    - Polarization (HH, HV, VV, VH)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
  notes:
    - Transformation to the logarithm decibel scale is not required or desired as this step can be completed by the user if necessary.
