    Measurements can be one of the following types or both: 
      
    - **Normalised Radar Covariance Matrix (CovMat)**
      Diagonal (equivalent to NRB) and upper diagonal elements of the terrain-flattened Gamma-Nought ($\gamma^0_T$) Covariance Matrix are provided for coherent dual (e.g., HH-HV, VV-VH, or …) and fully polarimetric (e.g., HH-HV-VH-VV) acquisitions.
    - **Polarimetric Radar Decomposition (PRD)**
      The individual components of the polarimetric decomposition obtained from the terrain-flattened (Gamma-Nought, $\gamma^0_T$) covariance matrix.

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Measurement Type (CovMat, PRD)
    - Measurement convention unit (linear amplitude, linear power, angle)
    - Individual covariance matrix element or/and Individual component of the decomposition (C3m11, C3m12, … or H, A, alpha, or …)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
  notes:
    # todo: add glossary entries for BIP, BIL, BSQ?
    - |-
      It is recommended to keep CovMat or PRD measurement files separated.
      Otherwise, specify the multi-channel format order (BIP, BIL, BSQ).
