# This requirement is not different to the ST requirement except that it links to traceability-sr instead of traceability-st.
# This should be solved by aligning the traceability requirements.
title: Measurement Uncertainty
description: |-
  Note: In current practice, users determine fitness for purpose based on knowledge of the lineage of the data, rather than on a specific estimate of measurement uncertainty.
threshold: null
goal:
  description: |-
    An estimate of the certainty of the values is provided in measurement units.
  notes:
    - This is a requirement for SI traceability. See also [@metadata/traceability-sr].
    - Information on measurement uncertainty should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
