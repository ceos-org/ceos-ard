title: Measurement Uncertainty
description: |-
  Note: In current practice, users determine fitness for purpose based on knowledge of the lineage of the data, rather than on a specific estimate of measurement uncertainty.
threshold: null
goal:
  # AR uses:
  # An estimate of the uncertainty of the values is provided in measurement units.
  # Following Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM).
  # todo: discuss whether the AR phrasing should be adopted for all PFS (+ add link to GUM?)
  description: |-
    An estimate of the certainty of the values is provided in measurement units. 
  notes:
    - This is a requirement for SI traceability. See also [@metadata/traceability].
    - Information on measurement uncertainty should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
