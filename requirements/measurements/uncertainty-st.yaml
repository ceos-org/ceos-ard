# This requirement is not different to the SR requirement except that it links to traceability-st instead of traceability-sr.
# This should be solved by aligning the traceability requirements.
title: Measurement Uncertainty
description:
threshold: null
goal:
  description: |-
    Uncertainty, in Kelvin, of the surface temperature measurement for each pixel is provided.
  notes:
    - |-
      Some of the intent of the initial wording (below), which refers to atmospheric windows, may have been lost: Uncertainty, in units Kelvin, of the surface temperature for each pixel is also accompanied by distance from cloud (above) and atmospheric transmission (intervals, i.e., 0.4 - 0.55, 0.55 - 0.7, etc.).
