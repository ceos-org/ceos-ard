    The Flattened Phase is the interferometric phase for which the topographic phase contribution is removed.
    It is derived from the range-Doppler SLC product using a DEM and the orbital state vectors with respect to a reference orbit (see [@sec:annex-sar-topographic-phase-removal]).
    The use of the Flattened Phase with the NRB or POL intensity ([@sec:rcm]) provides the GSLC equivalent, as follows:  

    $$
    \text{GSLC} = \sqrt{NRB} \times \exp(j \cdot \text{FlattenPhase})
    $$
    
    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:
