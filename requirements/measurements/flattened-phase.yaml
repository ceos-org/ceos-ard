  description: |-
    The Flattened Phase is the interferometric phase for which the topographic phase contribution is removed.
    It is derived from the range-Doppler SLC product using a DEM and the orbital state vectors with respect to a reference orbit (see [@sec:annex-sar-topographic-phase-removal]).
    The use of the Flattened Phase with the NRB or POL intensity ([@measurements/backscatter-measurement]) provides the GSLC equivalent, as follows:  

    ```
    GSLC = sqrt(NRB) x exp(j FlattenPhase)
    ```
    
    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Measurement Type (Flattened Phase)
    - Reference Polarization (HH/HV/VV/VH)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order

    In case of polarimetric data, indicate the reference polarization.

# todo: The dependency points to requirements that are different per PFS.
#       We probably need a mapping to requirements per PFS.
