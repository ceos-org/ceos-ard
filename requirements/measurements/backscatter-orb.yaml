    Geoid-corrected Sigma-Nought backscatter coefficient ($\sigma^0$) is provided for each polarization. 

    File format specifications/contents provided in metadata:

    - Measurement Type (Sigma-Nought)
    - Backscatter Expression Convention (linear amplitude, linear power\*)
    - Backscatter Conversion Equation
    - Polarization (HH, HV, VV, VH)
    - Data Format (GeoTIFF, HDF5, NetCDF, …)
    - Data Type (Int, Float, …)
    - Bits per Sample
    - Byte Order
  notes:
    - Transformation to the logarithm decibel scale is not required or desired as this step can be completed by the user if necessary.
