  description: |-
    Metadata is provided in a structure that enables a computer algorithm to be used consistently and to automatically identify and extract each component part for further use.
  notes:
goal:
  description: |-
    As threshold, but metadata should be provided in a community endorsed standard that facilitates machine-readability, such as ISO 19115-2.
