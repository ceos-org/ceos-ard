    In case the Look Direction Image (see [@per-pixel-metadata/look-direction]) is **not** provided, then a list of the polynomial coefficients ai necessary to reconstruct the look direction angle[^look-direction-angle], together with an estimate of the added error from use of polynomial vs. per-pixel more accurate values, shall be provided.

    Example polynomial:

    $$
    \text{LookDir} = a_{1}\text{Lat}^2 + a_{2}\text{Lon}^2 + a_{3}\text{LatLon} + a_{4}\text{Lat} + a_{5}\text{Lon} + a_6
    $$

    where:
    
    - $a_i$ = polynomial coefficients 
    - $\text{Lat}$ = latitude  
    - $\text{Lon}$ = longitude

    Lat and Lon are the related coordinates in the product map units (m, deg, arcsec).

    [^look-direction-angle]: The look direction angle represents the planar angle between north and each range direction. It is not constant in range, especially close to the poles.
