    Provide the absolute orbit number used as reference for topographic phase flattening.
    In case a virtual orbit has been used, provide orbit parameters or orbit state vectors as DOI or URL.

    Provide scene-centred perpendicular baseline for the for the source data relative to the reference orbit used (for approximate use only).
