    Information related to the platform orbit used for data processing:

    - Pass direction (asc/desc)[^orbit-pass-direction]
    - Orbit data source (e.g., predicted, definite, precise, downlinked, etc.)

    [^orbit-pass-direction]: For data crossing the North or South Pole, it is recommended to produce two distinct CEOS-ARD products and to use the appropriate “Pass direction” in each.

    - Platform heading angle expressed in degrees (0-360) from North 
    - Orbit data file containing state vectors (minimum of 5 state vectors, from 10% of scene length before start time to 10% of scene length after stop time) 
    - Platform (mean) altitude
