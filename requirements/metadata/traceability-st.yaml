    Data must be traceable to SI reference standard.

    - [Policy on measurement traceability](https://anab.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=6536)
    - [Guidance on measurement traceability](https://anab.qualtraxcloud.com/ShowDocument.aspx?ID=6532)
  # todo: the two links above are additions only in ST - can we align this with tracability.yaml?
  # todo: both documents lead to an error message only: "You do not have permission to view this document." which makes them useless.
  notes:
    - Relationship to [@measurements/uncertainty-st]. Traceability requires an estimate of measurement uncertainty.
    - Information on traceability should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
