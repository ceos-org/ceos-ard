title: Traceability

threshold: null
goal:
  description: Data must be traceable to SI reference standard.
  notes:
    # todo: Replace reference to 3.5 with a propert reference with the new ids.
    #       Also, better would be to not use references here as these are different between optical and sar.
    #       Potentially define a mapping so that we can use one reference for both, i.e. an alias for dependencies
    #       that we can set in the dependencies per PFS or so.
    # todo: Alternatively, as we also have a recursive reference in the dependencies,
    #       could we just remove "Relationship to [@measurements/uncertainty] or item 3.5 (SAR)."?

      Relationship to [@measurements/uncertainty] or item 3.5 (SAR).
      Traceability requires an estimate of measurement uncertainty.
    - Information on traceability should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
