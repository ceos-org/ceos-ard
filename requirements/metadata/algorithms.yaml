    All algorithms and versions, and the sequence in which they were applied in the generation process, are identified in the metadata.

  description: |-
    As threshold, but only algorithms that have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
  notes:
    - It is possible that high-quality corrections are applied through non-disclosed processes. CEOS-ARD does not per-se require full and open data and methods.
    - Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
