    Image attributes related to the source data:

    - Source Data geometry (slant range/ground range)
    - Azimuth pixel spacing \[m] (alternatively, Azimuth pixel spacing can be provided in second \[s], equivalent to the azimuth time sample interval) 
    - Range pixel spacing 
    - Azimuth resolution 
    - Range resolution 
    - Near range incident angle 
    - Far range incident angle
