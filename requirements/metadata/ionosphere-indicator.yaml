  # todo: The "(0 – false, 1 – true)" is implementation specific, it is also not clear whether 0 or 1 should be used of the boolean values (which may be T, True, WAHR, ... or F, False, UNWAHR, ... in other contexts).
  description: |-
    Flag indicating whether the backscatter imagery is “significantly impacted” by the ionosphere (0 – false, 1 – true).
    Significant impact would imply that the ionospheric impact on the backscatter exceeds the radiometric calibration requirement or goal for the imagery.
