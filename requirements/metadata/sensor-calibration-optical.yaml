  description: |-
    Sensor calibration parameters are identified in the metadata or can be accessed using details included in the metadata.
    Ideally this would support machine-to-machine access.
  notes:
    - Information on sensory calibration should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
  # This is exactly the same as sensor-calibration-sar.yaml except for the note added above. Can we align?
