title: Spectral Bands
description: 
threshold:
  description: |-
    The central wavelength for each band for which data is included is identified in the metadata, expressed in SI units.
  notes:
goal:
  description: |-
    As threshold, with instrument spectral response details (e.g., full spectral response function) also included or directly accessible using details in the metadata. 
    Central wavelength and bandwidth at full-width half maximum value of the relative spectral response function are provided at least.
  notes:
    - Information on spectral bands should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
