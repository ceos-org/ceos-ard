title: Geometric Correction Algorithm
description: 
threshold: null
goal:
  # todo: Optical uses:
  # "Information on geometric correction methods should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page, including reference database and auxiliary data such as elevation model(s) and reference chip-sets."
  # Added " such as elevation model(s) and reference chip-sets" to thirs bullet point, coming from Optical
  # What about "reference database"?

    Metadata references, e.g.: 
    - A metadata citable peer-reviewed algorithm,
    - Technical documentation regarding the implementation of that algorithm expressed as URLs or DOIs
    - The sources of auxiliary data used to make corrections such as elevation model(s) and reference chip-sets. 
    - Resampling method used for geometric processing of the source data. 
  notes:
    - Examples of technical documentation can include e.g., an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) or a product user guide.
