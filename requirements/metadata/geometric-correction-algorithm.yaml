  description: |-
    Metadata references, e.g.:
    
    - A metadata citable peer-reviewed algorithm
    - Technical documentation regarding the implementation of that algorithm expressed as URLs or DOIs
    - The sources of auxiliary data used to make corrections
    - Resampling method used for geometric processing of the source data
  notes:
    - Examples of technical documentation can include e.g., an Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) or a product user guide.
