  description: |-
    The metadata includes metrics describing the assessed absolute radiometric uncertainty of the version of the data or product, expressed as absolute radiometric uncertainty relative to appropriate, known reference sites and standards (for example, pseudo-invariant calibration sites, rigorously collected field spectra, Rayleigh, DCC, etc.)
  notes:
    - Information on radiometric accuracy should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
