  description: |-
    Provide performance indicators on data intensity noise level ($\text{NE}\sigma^0$ and/or $\text{NE}\beta^0$ and/or $\text{NE}\gamma^0$, i.e., noise equivalent Sigma- and/or Beta- and/or Gamma-Nought).
    Provided for each polarization channel when available.

    Parameter may be expressed as the mean and/or minimum and maximum noise equivalent values of the source data.

    Values do not need to be estimated individually for each product, but may be estimated once for each acquisition mode, and annotated on all products.
