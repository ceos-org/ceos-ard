    All algorithms, and the sequence in which they were applied in the generation process, are identified in the metadata.
    For example, these may be available through Algorithm Theoretical Basis documents.
  notes:
    -  Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.

  description: |-
    As threshold, but only algorithms that have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.
  notes:
    - It is possible that high-quality corrections are applied through non-disclosed processes. CEOS-ARD does not per-se require full and open data and methods.
    - Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.
