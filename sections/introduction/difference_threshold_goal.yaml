title: What is the difference between Threshold and Goal?
description: |-
  **Threshold** (or: minimum) requirements are the **minimum** that is needed for the data to be analysis ready.
  This must be practical and accepted by the data producers.

  **Goal** (or: desired) requirements (previously referred to as “Target”) are the ideal; where we would like to be.
  Some providers may already meet these. 

  Products that meet all _threshold_ requirements should be immediately useful for scientific analysis or decision-making.

  Products that meet _goal_ requirements will reduce the overall product uncertainties and enhance broad-scale applications.
  For example, the products may enhance interoperability or provide increased accuracy through additional corrections that are not reasonable at the _threshold_ level.

  Goal requirements anticipate continuous improvement of methods and evolution of community expectations, which are both normal and inevitable in a developing field.
  Over time, _goal_ specifications may (and subject to due process) become accepted as _threshold_ requirements.
