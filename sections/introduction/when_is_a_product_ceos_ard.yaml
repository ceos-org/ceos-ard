title: When can a product be called CEOS-ARD?
description: |-
  The CEOS-ARD branding is applied to a particular product once:

  - that product has been assessed as meeting CEOS-ARD requirements by the agency or other entities responsible for production and distribution of the product, and
  - that the assessment has been peer reviewed by the relevant CEOS team(s).

  Agencies or other entities considering undertaking an assessment process should consult the [CEOS-ARD Governance Framework](https://ceos.org/ard/files/CEOS_ARD_Governance_Framework_18-October-2021.pdf) or contact <mailto:ard-contact@lists.ceos.org>.

  A product can continue to use CEOS-ARD branding as long as its generation and distribution remain consistent with the peer-reviewed assessment.
