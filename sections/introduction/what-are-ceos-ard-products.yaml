title: What is CEOS Analysis Ready Data?
description: |-
  CEOS-ARD are products that have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort.
  In general, these products would be resampled onto a common geometric grid (for a given product) and would provide baseline data for further interoperability both through time and with other datasets.

  CEOS-ARD products are intended to be flexible and accessible products suitable for a wide range of users for a wide variety of applications, including particularly time series analysis and multi-sensor application development.
  They are also intended to support rapid ingestion and exploitation via high-performance computing, cloud computing and other future data architectures.
  They may not be suitable for all purposes and are not intended as a _replacement_ for other types of satellite products.
