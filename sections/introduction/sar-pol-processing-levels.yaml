title: Which processing levels are defined in the CEOS-ARD Polarimetric Radar PFS?
description: |-
  The POL product can be defined in two processing levels:

  The **normalised covariance matrix (CovMat)** representation (C2 or C3) which preserves the inter-channel polarimetric phase(s) and maximizes the available information for users.
  Interoperability within current CEOS-ARD SAR backscatter definition is preserved, since diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are backscatter intensities.
  Scattering information enhancement can be achieved by applying incoherent polarimetric decomposition techniques (e.g., Freeman-Durden, van Zyl, Cloude-Pottier, Yamaguchi-based) directly on the C2 or C3 matrix.

  **Polarimetric Radar Decomposition (PRD)** refers to ARD products where polarimetric information is broken down into simplified parameters to facilitate user interpretation of the data.
  They are derived from coherent or incoherent polarimetric decomposition techniques.
