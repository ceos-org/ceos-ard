title: Which limitations apply to CEOS-ARD Polarimetric Radar?
description: |-
  For Polarimetric Radar (POL) products, optimal incoherent Polarimetric Radar Decomposition (PRD) should be performed under the slant range projection [@gens2013; @toutin2013].
  In order to minimise bias in the CEOS-ARD SAR Level-2A covariance matrix product, speckle filtering and averaging of the covariance matrix should be applied in the slant range projection, and geocoding should be performed using nearest-neighbour resampling.
  Specifically, nearest-neighbour resampling ensures that the averaged covariance matrix elements in slant range and in geocoded ground projection are exactly the same.
  Consequently, the polarimetrically derived parameters are exactly equal in both approaches (assuming that no further averaging is performed on the ARD product for decomposing the polarimetric information).
  Bilinear and average resampling methods are also suitable for resampling the covariance matrix, but some differences with polarimetric parameters generated in slant range and then resampled (bilinear) might be observed on sloped terrains.
  Even if Sinc interpolation may be more robust for spatial resampling, it does not preserve covariance matrix integrity, and should consequently not be used for this ARD product.

  It is recommended that ARD providers who desire to distribute PRD products decompose the polarimetric information starting from Level-1 SLC data and then geocode the derived parameters rather than use the CovMat ARD product.
  Resampling can be performed using any of the supported methods (nearest-neighbour, bilinear, average, bi-cubic spline or Lanczos are recommended), which need to be indicated in the product metadata.
  Note that coherent decomposition techniques cannot be performed on CovMat ARD products.

  Covariance matrix products contain a variable number of layers (or bands) with different data types depending on the polarimetric mode (full or dual) and decomposition technique.
  The CovMat products for the C2 matrix have 3 layers (2 real-valued diagonal elements and 1 complex-valued off-diagonal element).
  CovMat products for the C3 matrix have 6 layers (3 real-valued diagonal elements and 3 complex-valued off-diagonal elements).
  Layers that can be obtained via a complex conjugation of other layers are not provided within the product.
  Polarimetric Decomposition products contain typically 2 to 4 (or more) real-valued layers depending on the particular decomposition algorithm.
  Within the CovMat product files, ARD layers are organized in order to reduce access delays and maximize efficiency in extracting the desired information.
  In CovMat products, geographically contiguous samples for each layer may be stored next to each other and organized “layer by layer”.
  Alternatively, samples belonging to the same covariance matrix might be stored next to each other and organized “matrix by matrix”.
  PRD products are organized “layer by layer”, i.e., with bands corresponding to the output of the polarimetric decomposition stored next to each other.
