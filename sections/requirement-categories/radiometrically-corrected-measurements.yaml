title: Radiometrically Corrected Measurements
description: |-
  The requirements indicate the necessary outcomes and, to some degree, the minimum steps necessary to be deemed to have achieved those outcomes.
  Radiometric corrections must lead to normalised measurement(s) of backscatter intensity and/or decomposed polarimetric parameters.
  As for the per-pixel metadata, information regarding data format specification needs to be provided for each record.
  The requirements below must be met for all pixels/samples/observations in a collection.

  *Cloud optimized file formats are recommended.*
