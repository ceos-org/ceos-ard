  Radiometric corrections must lead to normalised measurement(s) of backscatter intensity and/or decomposed polarimetric parameters.
  As for the per-pixel metadata, information regarding data format specification needs to be provided for each record.
  The requirements below must be met for all pixels/samples/observations in a collection.
