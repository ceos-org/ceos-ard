title: Surface Temperature
type: Optical
applies_to: |-
  Data collected with multispectral sensors operating in the thermal infrared (TIR) wavelengths.
  These typically operate with ground sample distance and resolution in the order of 10-100m;
  however, the Specification is not inherently limited to this resolution.

  At present, surface temperature measurements tend to be provided as either surface brightness temperature (SBT) or as land surface temperatures (LST) requiring the SBT to be modified according to the emissivity of the target.
  This specification identifies the Surface Temperature (ST) as being the minimum or Threshold requirement for analysis ready land surface data. Nevertheless, both SBT and LST are land measurements, requiring atmospheric corrections.
