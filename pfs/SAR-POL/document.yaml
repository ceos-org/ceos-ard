  This PFS is specifically aimed at users interested in exploring the potential of SAR but who may lack the expertise or facilities for SAR processing.

  The CEOS-ARD Polarimetric Radar (POL) product format is an extension of the CEOS-ARD Normalised Radar Backscatter (NRB) format.
  This extension is required in order to better support Level-1 SLC polarimetric data, including full-polarimetric modes (e.g., RADARSAT-2, ALOS-2/4, SAOCOM-1 and future missions), and hybrid or linear dual-polarimetric modes (i.e., Compact Polarimetric mode available on RCM, SAOCOM and the upcoming NISAR mission).
