  This PFS is specifically aimed at users interested in exploring the potential of SAR but who may lack the expertise or facilities for SAR processing.

  The CEOS-ARD Ocean Radar Backscatter (ORB) product specification describes products that have been projected on a geoid and are provided in the Sigma-Nought ($\sigma^0$) backscatter convention, which is recommended for most ocean applications.
  Backscatter may be calibrated to the ellipsoid ($\sigma^0_E$) or radiometrically terrain corrected ($\sigma^0_T$) prior to geometric terrain correction.
  As the basic ORB product contains backscatter values only, it _cannot_ be directly used for SAR polarimetry or interferometric applications that require local phase estimates.
  Nonetheless, an advanced ORB product could include the upper diagonal of the polarimetric $\sigma^0$ covariance matrix for enabling advanced polarimetric analysis (similar to the POL product).
