  This PFS is specifically aimed at users interested in exploring the potential of SAR but who may lack the expertise or facilities for SAR processing.

  The CEOS-ARD Geocoded Single-Look Complex (GSLC) product is relevant to interferometric studies.
  The GSLC product is derived from the range-Doppler (i.e. slant range) Single-Look Complex (SLC) product using a DEM and the orbital state vectors and output in the map projected system.
  The phase of a geocoded SLC is “flattened” with respect to a reference orbit and to a DEM, to eliminate topographic phase contributions [@zebker2017; @zheng2017].
  The sample spacing of the GSLC product in the map coordinate directions is comparable to the full resolution original SLC product.
  The GSLC product can be directly overlaid on a map or combined with other similar GSLC products to derive interferograms and create change maps, for example.
  Since the GSLC phase is flattened, the phase difference between two GSLC products acquired on a same relative orbit produces an interferogram referring only to surface displacement and noise (i.e., no topographic fringes).
  The GSLC product may optionally be radiometrically terrain corrected such that the squared amplitude yields $\gamma^0_T$.
