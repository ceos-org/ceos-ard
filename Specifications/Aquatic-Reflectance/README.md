# CEOS-ARD PFS: Aquatic Reflectance

Applies to data collected with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors operating in the VIS/NIR/SWIR wavelengths over water bodies. These typically operate with ground sample distance and resolution in the order of 10-1000 m; however, the specification is not inherently limited to this resolution.

This document gives an overview of where the different versions of the Product Family Specification (PFS) can be found.
