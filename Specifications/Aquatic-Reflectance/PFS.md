## Description

**Product Family Title: Aquatic Reflectance (CARD4L-AR)**

**Applies to:** Data collected with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors operating in the VIS/NIR/SWIR wavelengths over water bodies. These typically operate with ground sample distance and resolution in the order of 10-1000 m; however, the specification is not inherently limited to this resolution.

|       Ancillary Data       | Data other than instrument measurements, originating in the instrument itself or from the satellite, required to perform processing of the data. They include orbit data, attitude data, time information, spacecraft engineering data, calibration data, data quality information, and data from other instruments. |
|       Auxiliary Data       | The data required for instrument processing, which does not originate in the instrument itself or from the satellite. Some auxiliary data will be generated in the ground segment, whilst other data will be provided from external sources. |
|          Metadata          | Structured information that describes other information or information services. With well-defined metadata, users should be able to get basic information about data, without the need to have knowledge about its entire content. |
|            MTF             | Modulation Transfer Function                                 |
|    Spectral Resolution     | Defines the narrowest spectral feature that can be resolved by a spectrometer. |
|     Spatial Resolution     | The highest magnification of the sensor at the ground surface. |
| Spectral Sampling Distance | Spectral sampling is the interval, in wavelength units, between discrete data points in the measured spectrum. |
| Spatial Sampling Distance  | Spatial sampling distance is the barycentre-to-barycentre distance between adjacent spatial samples on the Earth's surface. |

## Requirements

### General Metadata

*These are metadata records describing a distributed collection of pixels. The collection of pixels referred to must be contiguous in space and time. General metadata should allow the user to assess the **overall** suitability of the dataset, and must meet the following requirements:*

Traceability requires an estimate of measurement uncertainty.&#10;Note 2: Information on traceability should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.* |                           |                        |                                            |                                      |
| **1.2**  |  **Metadata Machine Readability**  | Metadata is provided in a structure that enables a computer algorithm to be used consistently and to automatically identify and extract each component part for further use. | As threshold, but metadata should be provided in a community endorsed standard that facilitates machine-readability, such as ISO 19115-2. |                           |                        |                                            |                                      |

| **1.4**  |       **Geographical Area**        | The surface location to which the data relates is identified, typically as a series of four corner points, expressed in an accepted coordinate reference system (e.g., WGS84). | The geographic area covered by the observations is identified specifically, such as through a set of coordinates of a closely bounding polygon. The location to which each pixel refers is identified (or can be reliably determined) with the projection system (if any) and reference datum provided. |                           |                        |                                            |                                      |

| **1.8**  | **Geometric Accuracy of the Data** | Not required.&#10;The user is not provided with results of geometric accuracy assessments pertaining to the dataset. | The metadata includes metrics describing the assessed geodetic accuracy of the data, expressed units of the coordinate system of the data. Accuracy is assessed by independent verification (as well as internal model-fit where applicable). Uncertainties are expressed quantitatively, for example, as root mean square error (RMSE) or Circular Error Probability (CEP90, CEP95), etc.&#10;*Note 1: Information on geometric accuracy of the data should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.* |                           |                        |                                            |                                      |

| **1.11** |       **Sensor Calibration**       | Not required.&#10;The general metadata does not include sensor calibration details. | Sensor calibration parameters are identified in the metadata or can be accessed using details included in the metadata. Ideally this would support machine-to-machine access.&#10;*Note 1: Information on sensor calibration should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.* |                           |                        |                                            |                                      |

For example, these may be available through Algorithm Theoretical Basis documents.&#10;*Note 1: Information on algorithms should be available in the metadata as a single DOI landing page.* | As threshold, but only algorithms that have been published in a peer-reviewed journal.&#10;*Note 1: It is possible that high-quality corrections are applied through non-disclosed processes.

### Per-Pixel Metadata

*The following minimum metadata specifications apply to each pixel. Whether the metadata are provided in a single record relevant to all pixels, or separately for each pixel, is at the discretion of the data provider. Per-pixel metadata should allow users to discriminate between (choose) observations on the basis of their individual suitability for application.*

### Radiometric and Atmospheric Corrections

*The following requirements must be met for all pixels in a collection. The requirements indicate both the necessary outcomes (3.1-3.3) and the minimum steps necessary to be deemed to have achieved those outcomes (3.4 onwards). Radiometric corrections must lead to a valid measurement of aquatic reflectance.*

## Guidance

This section aims to provide background and specific information on the processing steps that can be used to achieve analysis ready data. This Guidance material does not replace or override the specifications.

## Introduction to CARD4L

### What is CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) products?

CARD4L products have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort. These products would be resampled onto a common geometric grid (for a given product) and would provide baseline data for further interoperability both through time and with other datasets.

CARD4L products are intended to be flexible and accessible products suitable for a wide range of users for a wide variety of applications, including particularly time series analysis and multi-sensor application development. They are also intended to support rapid ingestion and exploitation via high-performance computing, cloud computing and other future data architectures. They may not be suitable for all purposes and are not intended as a ‘replacement’ for other types of satellite products.

### When can a product be called CARD4L?

The CARD4L branding is applied to a particular product once:

- that product has been assessed as meeting CARD4L requirements by the agency responsible for production and distribution of the product, and
- that assessment has been peer reviewed by the CEOS Land Surface Imaging Virtual Constellation in consultation with other CEOS working groups as appropriate, including the CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation.

Agencies or other entities considering undertaking an assessment process should contact the [Land Surface Imaging Virtual Constellation](http://ceos.org/ourwork/virtual-constellations/lsi/).

A product can continue to use CARD4L branding as long as its generation and distribution remain consistent with the peer-reviewed assessment.

### What is the difference between Threshold and Target?

Products that meet all threshold requirements should be immediately useful for scientific analysis or decision-making.

Products that meet target requirements will reduce the overall product uncertainties and enhance broad-scale applications. For example, the products may enhance interoperability or provide increased accuracy through additional corrections that are not reasonable at the *threshold* level.

Target requirements anticipate continuous improvement of methods and evolution of community expectations, which are both normal and inevitable in a developing field. Over time, *target* specifications may (and subject to due process) become accepted as *threshold* requirements.

## Procedural Examples
