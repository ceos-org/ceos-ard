## Description

**Product Family Title: Surface Temperature (CARD4L-ST)**

**Applies to:** Data collected with multispectral sensors operating in the thermal infrared (TIR) wavelengths. These typically operate with ground sample distance and resolution in the order of 10-100m; however, the Specification is not inherently limited to this resolution.

At present, surface temperature measurements tend to be provided as either surface brightness temperature (SBT) or as land surface temperatures (LST) requiring the SBT to be modified according to the emissivity of the target. This specification identifies the Surface Temperature (ST) as being the minimum or Threshold requirement for analysis ready land surface data. Nevertheless, both SBT and LST are *land* measurements, requiring atmospheric corrections.

| **1.4**  |       **Geographical Area**        | The surface location to which the data relate is identified, typically as a series of four corner points, expressed in an accepted coordinate reference system (e.g., WGS84 coordinates). | The geographic area covered by the observations is identified specifically, such as through a set of coordinates of a closely bounding polygon.

### Per-Pixel Metadata

*Per-pixel metadata should allow users to discriminate between (choose) observations on the basis of their individual suitability for application and includes ‘quality flags’. The following minimum metadata specifications apply to each pixel. Whether the metadata are provided in a single record relevant to all pixels or separately for each pixel is at the discretion of the data provider. Similarly, the mechanism or form of the per-pixel metadata (additional data bands, mask layers, etc.) is open to the provider.*

## Guidance

This section aims to provide background and specific information on the processing steps that can be used to achieve analysis ready data. This Guidance material does not replace or override the specifications.

## Introduction to CARD4L

### What is CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) products?

CARD4L products have been processed to a minimum set of requirements and organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort. These products would be resampled onto a common geometric grid (for a given product) and would provide baseline data for further interoperability both through time and with other datasets.

CARD4L products are intended to be flexible and accessible products suitable for a wide range of users for a wide variety of applications, including particularly time series analysis and multi-sensor application development. They are also intended to support rapid ingestion and exploitation via high-performance computing, cloud computing and other future data architectures. They may not be suitable for all purposes and are not intended as a ‘replacement’ for other types of satellite products.

### When can a product be called CARD4L?

The CARD4L branding is applied to a particular product once:

- that product has been assessed as meeting CARD4L requirements by the agency responsible for production and distribution of the product, and
- that assessment has been peer reviewed by the CEOS Land Surface Imaging Virtual Constellation in consultation with the CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation.

Agencies or other entities considering undertaking an assessment process should contact the co-leads of the [Land Surface Imaging Virtual Constellation](http://ceos.org/ourwork/virtual-constellations/lsi/). 

A product can continue to use CARD4L branding as long as its generation and distribution remain consistent with the peer-reviewed assessment.

### What is the difference between Threshold and Target?

Products that meet all threshold requirements should be immediately useful for scientific analysis or decision-making. 

Products that meet target requirements will reduce the overall product uncertainties and enhance broad-scale applications. For example, the products may enhance interoperability or provide increased accuracy through additional corrections that are not reasonable at the *threshold* level. 

Target requirements anticipate continuous improvement of methods and evolution of community expectations, which are both normal and inevitable in a developing field. Over time, *target* specifications may (and subject to due process) become accepted as *threshold* requirements.
