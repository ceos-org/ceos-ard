## Annex 4: Geocoded Single-Look Complex \[GSLC] example

In contrast to basic **\[NRB]** and **\[POL] products**, CEOS-ARD Geocoded SLC **\[GSLC]** products are kept close to the native resolution in complex data format for which local topographic InSAR phases, relative to a reference orbit (Zebker et al., 2010; Zebker 2017), have been removed. Having a volume of **\[GSLC]** products acquired over repeat cycles, already radiometric and phase terrain corrected and geocoded (Figure A4.1a) and Figure A4.1b), allows user-friendly production of a first iteration of the InSAR coherence (Eq. A4.1 and Figure A4.1c) and differential phases (Eq. A4.2 and Figure A4.1d) in between **\[GSLC]** pairs, simply by applying local averaging window over the product of a **\[GSLC]** product (GSLC1) with the complex conjugate of a second **\[GSLC]** (GSLC2) divided by their local averaged intensities. These intermediate files could be used for coherent change detection analysis and surface displacement monitoring.

$$ \tag{Eq. A4.1} \text{Complex coherence:} \quad \rho = \frac{\sum [ GSLC_1 * conj (GSLC_2)]}{ \sqrt{ \sum |GSLC_1|^2 * \sum |GSLC_2|^2}} $$

The InSAR differential phase (Eq. A4.2) is the argument of the complex coherence estimated with
Eq. 4.1.

$$ \tag{Eq. A4.2} \text{InSAR differential phase:} \quad \varphi =\arg(\rho) $$

Some advanced \[NRB] or \[POL] products could include per-pixel “Flattened Phase” data (item 3.7). This “Flattened Phase” enables the possibility to perform InSAR analysis as with two \[GSLC] products. As for example, from two different \[NRB] products (NRB1) and (NRB2), acquired over repeat cycles (i.e., on the same relative orbit), containing $`\gamma_T^0`$ and their corresponding “Flattened Phase” (FPh1) and (FPh2) per-pixel data, the complex InSAR coherence (Eq. A4.3) can be estimated in the similar manner as Eq. A4.1 for \[GSLC] products.

$$ \tag{Eq. A4.3} \text{Complex coherence:} \quad \rho_{NRB} = \frac{\sum [ (\sqrt{NRB_1} \cdot e^{i\cdot FPh1}) \cdot conj (\sqrt{NRB_2} \cdot e^{i\cdot FPh2})]}{ \sqrt{ \sum NRB_1 * \sum NRB_2}} $$

Some advanced \[GSLC] product can be provided with “2.12 Radar Unit Look Vector Grid Image” per-pixel metadata (Figure A4.2) which gives the accurate 3-D components radar unit look vector used as for example in decomposing the vertical and horizontal component of an InSAR surface displacement estimate.
