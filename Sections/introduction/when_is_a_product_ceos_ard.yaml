title: When can a product be called CEOS-ARD?
description: |-
  The CEOS-ARD branding is applied to a particular product once:

  - that product has been assessed as meeting CEOS-ARD requirements by the agency responsible for production and distribution of the product, and
  - that assessment has been peer reviewed by the CEOS Working Group on Calibration and Validation.

  Agencies or other entities considering undertaking an assessment process should contact <mailto:ard-contact@lists.ceos.org>.

  A product can continue to use CEOS-ARD branding as long as its generation and distribution remain consistent with the peer-reviewed assessment.
