title: What is the difference between Threshold and Goal?
description: |-
  Products that meet all threshold requirements should be immediately useful for scientific analysis or decision-making.

  Products that meet Goal requirements will reduce the overall product uncertainties and enhance broad-scale applications.
  For example, the products may enhance interoperability or provide increased accuracy through additional corrections that are not reasonable at the _threshold_ level.

  Goal requirements anticipate continuous improvement of methods and evolution of community expectations, which are both normal and inevitable in a developing field.
  Over time, Goal specifications may (and subject to due process) become accepted as _threshold_ requirements.
