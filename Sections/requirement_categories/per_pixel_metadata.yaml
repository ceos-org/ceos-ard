title: Per-Pixel Metadata
description: |-
  The following minimum metadata specifications apply to each pixel.
  Whether the metadata are provided in a single record relevant to all pixels or separately for each pixel is at the discretion of the data provider.
  Per-pixel metadata should allow users to discriminate between (choose) observations on the basis of their individual suitability for application.
